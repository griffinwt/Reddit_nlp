playstation,jc4070,ImmaPoodle,0,"So watch dogs legion is coming out soon and with interesting mechanics and ray tracing I think it might be what people thought watch dogs 2 would be... a predecessor to GTA 5, ok let's be honest watch dogs 2 was an amazing game but it lacked that feeling that GTA had as well as the already large player base.

But this time with already tons of preordered copies of watch dogs legion in circle and Rockstar Games releasing very little news on GTA 6 and GTA Online not coming to the next gen consoles until 2021 people are gonna want to play on the new consoles but play a game that fills that void at up to 120fps and 8k resolution.

here's where watch dogs comes in with a GTA style game set in the near future with hacking, more passive weapons, the ability to play as anyone in London and speaking of finally a game based outside of the United States. This new game will also give long time players a shot of nostalgia with DLC characters Aiden Pearce from Watch Dogs and Wrench from Watch Dogs 2.

I truly believe that Watch Dogs Legion is a worthy competitor against the Grand Theft Auto series, and I have preordered the game and can't wait for launch.

What bothers me is the party changes.  In order to have an open party that anyone in your friends list can join, you essentially need to be in a group with all of your friends.

So everyone is in tens or hundreds of groups at a time - just to be able to freely join parties like the old system.

This overhaul seems to have come out of nowhere, with no way to know how it works alongside the whole friends list fiasco. But I beg you to read this post, to get a better understanding of it and to hopefully make you realise that this update is not as bad as you may think.

Parties and Messages are being mixed into one big thing, making group chats permanent parties of sorts. Think of it as a Discord server. You have a permanent group chat, and you can start a call (Party) anytime you want, leaving the same people in that group even after logging off, so that when you log back on there's no need to manually invite everyone else again. You can just start that same party back up and everyone can join by themselves. That's right, the reason there no longer is a ""Private/Public"" party option is because ALL PARTIES ARE PRIVATE forever. 

Next up, I've seen people complain about not being able to kick people from parties anymore. To clarify, there IS a way to kick people, but it obviously only works for whoever created the group. All you have to do is go to Messages, go to the group you're using, scroll to the person you want to kick, press options and click ""Remove from group.""

A couple details to note is that now you can see if anybody's muted, and if you mute someone else's mic, that person can still hear you, although if you do not want that to happen, you can still block them. I've also seen people scared after getting a ""Party chat may be recorded"" alert, and I want to clarify; you're NOT being listened to. Voice calls CAN be recorded and submitted by players if there is anybody being toxic or a bit too edgy, so that they can send these calls to Sony and hopefully get that player banned.

To finish up, there is also a new ""Mute all mics"" button in your Sounds/Devices tab in the quick menu. This will immediately mute all mic inputs and is a toggleable option, meaning you have to deactivate it manually.",Guide for revamped party system,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/jbyvha/guide_for_revamped_party_system/

I honestly despise looking for themes or avatars and I'd wager most people do as well. It's tricky to even find the pages on the PS Store as you have to get there from your settings, and they are littered with low quality content. There are about 300 of the same exact edgy, hooded anon ""gamer"" avatars literally nobody would use in 2020, dabbing babies, cheap pin-up crap, comic sans and MS Paint level garbage, and some games nobody has ever even heard of with every minor background character available as an avatar littering the store. Some games upload avatars having absolutely nothing to do with their game. I am tired of sifting through hundreds of outdated and low effort avatars and themes to find 1 good one to use, and then I find that 1 good one is either limited and I'm unable to buy it or in the case of themes, low res or broken. An overhaul is so long overdue, and I was really hoping it would come with 8.0.",Avatars and Themes,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/jbycga/avatars_and_themes/

playstation,jbxmym,Bunkit18,2,"So up until yesterday, I had a fully functional playstation pro and two working official dual shock controllers. 

This morning, I updated the system to 8.0. 

Since then, BOTH my controllers can't stay connected. BOTH will flash white after temporarily working, getting to a game, perhaps fully starting an online match. And then suddenly drop. 

What I've tried so far:

Turning off and on again.
Resetting controllers.
Booting in safe mode and reinstalling latest update.
Both with and without USB cable.
Changing USB cable.

Nothing has worked. Neither controller holds its connection without turning to the flashing white light again. I know for a fact my playstation and controllers are in perfect condition. This has only happened since I updated this morning.

Any ideas of why this is happening and how to fix?

playstation,jbx09x,Champion-Racer12,0,"So have you been having problems with system stability after the new update? Well two tricks may help you out and may even speed up your system and remove any corrupted files.

So first off, you just ensure you've switched off your console but left your TV switched on.

Then hold the power button on the PS4 for seven seconds until the system beeps twice, the system will enter safe mode. Now connect your charger cable to your PS4 and tap the PS button.

Then go to Option 5 ""Rebuild Database"" and follow the on screen message. The system will then reboot and database rebuild will begin. This'll clear out cache, file corruption and ""defrag"" the hard drive. Hence how your system can become faster.

Now if you're still having issues, we will now reinstall the full system software through option 3 ""Update System Software"". However, the reason I said a USB was needed was because you can't just download the full partition variant through safe mode on the PS4 itself.

#Reinstalling the System Software Steps:

1. Get a 1.1GB or more space USB drive and plug it into your computer (An Android device via OTG cable can be used too). 

1a. Format your USB as exFAT or fat32 (exFAT recommended).

2. Download the firmware from the PS site
#Look carefully!!! Find the ""reinstallation file"" or else you're just downloading a potential problem again. 

3. Then on the drive, create these folders [PS4] -&gt; [UPDATE] [PS4UPDATE.PUP file you downloaded].

Now eject your USB and back to the PS4: 

#Once again, hold down the power button for seven seconds until you enter safe mode and connect a USB cable to your controller and press the PS button. Then go to option 3 ""Update System Software"" and follow the prompts. 

Done!!!","To those who had stability problems with the new 8.00 update, I have two tricks that may work for you.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/jbx09x/to_those_who_had_stability_problems_with_the_new/
