xbox,jc40iu,ImmaPoodle,1,"So watch dogs legion is coming out soon and with interesting mechanics and ray tracing I think it might be what people thought watch dogs 2 would be... a predecessor to GTA 5, ok let's be honest watch dogs 2 was an amazing game but it lacked that feeling that GTA had as well as the already large player base.

But this time with already tons of preordered copies of watch dogs legion in circle and Rockstar Games releasing very little news on GTA 6 and GTA Online not coming to the next gen consoles until 2021 people are gonna want to play on the new consoles but play a game that fills that void at up to 120fps and 8k resolution.

here's where watch dogs comes in with a GTA style game set in the near future with hacking, more passive weapons, the ability to play as anyone in London and speaking of finally a game based outside of the United States. This new game will also give long time players a shot of nostalgia with DLC characters Aiden Pearce from Watch Dogs and Wrench from Watch Dogs 2.

I truly believe that Watch Dogs Legion is a worthy competitor against the Grand Theft Auto series, and I have preordered the game and can't wait for launch. Its also a game possibly worthy of a Game Of The Year award.",Ubisoft vs Rockstar,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/jc40iu/ubisoft_vs_rockstar/

also, if it is 100% broken for some random reason, is there anything useful i can salvage from it? like use a disc drive on a computer or take the hard drive out and use it somewhere else?

I can use a VPN if that solves the problem. But because I don’t have anyone I play games with irl most of the people I game with I don’t know, hence joining a party for a mission or something.

xbox,jbz6sk,mikeysof,2,"Hi all. Tried searching Google to no avail and need some advice. 

I bought a WD 14TB external hdd and plugged it into my xbox one x.

No issue so far.

I then go nuts and decide to install all 500+ games onto it one after another in alphabetical order (intending to have them available for series x when it arrives) 

Again, all seems OK, just noting around 1000 download in the queue (due to DLC etc).

I turn it off to low power mode and let it do its thing.

Now,whwn I turn it back on a few hours later it goes to home screen but then black screens for 5-10 seconds and every time I try to access the software list to pause downloads it resets black screen to home screen.

The blade works on this black screen so it's not cutting the image feed. Just seemingly overwhelmed or stuck in a weird loop.

Now the downloads are still working as I can see the network activity on my router and when I turn it on it does show some items have installed.

I figure I can leave it until its done days from now but I wonder if there is a reason / solution to the home page looping reset / black screen.

I have tried switching it to full shutdown and also unplugged the power supply at the back, but on reboot its still looping the black screen.

I did debate unplugging the hard drive after full shutdown and reboot and see if I can pause the download list but for now I'd rather leave it to download.

xbox,jbssf6,heyitISharvey,10,"So I have a PS5 Pre-Order, plus I've pre-ordered an extra Dualsense, DS Charging Station and Media Remote. (Not flexing) Like most I only have money for one console, a few games or accessories.

But I'm having second thoughts, if I list the reasons it looks like this.

PS5 Pros

1. Bought all games last gen on PS4 will work on PS5 (PS5 doesn't sound like a plane) \[I have Asperger's and tinnitus and the fan sound sets off my ears/anxiety.\]
2. Great Exclusives (Unpopular opinion TLOU Part II is my GOTY, love God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, basically all PS Exclusives and need to play Horizon.
3. Had PS consoles since childhood.

PS5 Cons

1. PS Now is really bad besides the PS4 downloads (about 10% of the service)
2. PS5 UI looks really cluttered and seems really focused on social features
3. No PS1, PS2 or PS3 backwards compatibility \[I can understand the PS3 with its complex hardware but come on Sony at least tell us that you're looking into it.\]
4. £70/$70 games (exclusives mostly)

Xbox Pros

1. Game Pass/Ultimate \[one price lots of games and online, plus PC and mobile.\] All first party games stay on Game Pass so no need to pay full price for them.
2. Backwards Compatibility (yes technically it's limited for 360 and OG but all those games run great and are mostly games I haven't played.)
3. I have a bit of weakness called Halo, I also like Gears, Fable, Forza Horizon.
4. Accessibility options/Xbox Elite controller

Xbox Cons

1. No haptics or resistive triggers (I know after launch most devs probably will forget about these on PS5 except for 1st party but from what we've heard about Returnal's adaptive trigger weapon switching this tech and haptics could benefit gameplay feedback.
2. Xbox's lack(ish) of great Japanese titles missing most of Yakuza and no Persona 5, no FF XIV and of course Death Stranding.

I may edit this later but, that's most of what I can think about now. Thanks for any replies but please no hate for trying to work out how to spend my money best.

To my surprise I noticed my balance went down triple the amount I was paying (bought two items, one duplicated).

xbox,jbf03j,Photomegaballbat,5,"So recently, weird accounts have just followed me for no reason and these people aren’t my friends, but there is something else weird about this. These accounts usually have a hot young girl (not nsfw) as their picture and they seem to follow lots of people too. The accounts don’t look new and have playtime on some games but it’s very weird and I think this is some sort of scam. 

My theories 

1. Possible maybe these account were hacked into so that if you check to see who they are, they will loom like a normal person. If this is true then I think they use bots to follow the account and for some reason they unfollow in a short amount of time, I mean short (one of these accounts followed me and now it unfollowed me).

2. Possible that with bots they follow people to get their username and other info on the persons account to then do things.

I’m not sure what it could be and why they want to follow so many people",Weird accounts keep on following me,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/jbf03j/weird_accounts_keep_on_following_me/

xbox,jbefvi,Wise-Lack7290,3,"Ok my Reddit fellas. I have a dilema and I want your honest opinion.
So here’s the situation.
I’m gonna get a Series X (whenever they become available to physically but them at GameStop) which means, obviously, a new gen console. My current account on the One X has a bit over 21 thousand gamer points and it has games that for some reason got downloaded to my library which bothers me (OCD reasons) and I don’t like see it there. Also it has some “strikes” (communication bans and comments removed). And finally, me and my ex pal had a fallout and even tho I blocked him, I kinda don’t want him to know that I’m still around playing. 
On the other hand, I’d like to start everything all over again with a fresh account, Xbox generated GT and a clean slate. Let’s face it, it’s a new gen Xbox. I don’t have many friends on the Xbox anyway, I kinda like to play by myself.
