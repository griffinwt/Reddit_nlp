       "2  I've realised this. i'm too indecisive and dont even know my own feelings, like sometimes i can't tell if I'm attracted to someone or not, my opinions on everything and feelings changed everyday. Im also afraid of intimacy, i hate touching people, i dont know how to show people i'm into them, i don't know how to tell people im into them, i also cant tell if someones into me (apart from a girl who tried to give me a handjob in maccies once). You know when you're horny and you're thinking about having sex and stuff, but the reality is i dont think i can do that, i couldnt even touch someone never mind put my dick in them. And the thing is ive kinda come to terms with this and i really wish i could just focus on my career and getting the car i want and doing the vlunteering i want to do, and move out of my parents house and get wolfdog (im on a 2 year waiting list for one :D). \\n\\nThere's other things i want in life, but im finding it very difficult achieving them, because this is on my mind a lot. Like i cant watch porn anymore, i cant watch people have sex when i never will, i hate being horny because i hate thinking about this. \\n\\nIts something ive thought a lot about for literally the last 8-10 years (im 22), some of my friends were having sex at 14, even the weird kid that got bullied did when he was 17, and the last person to lose it, one of my friends, who was 21.\\n\\nI just wish i could stop thinking about it forever, ive cried enough about it already, but the fact is in my imagination, in my head, when im horny i want sex. But in reality i couldn't do it   \n",

So I went on to ask the playstation representative if their was anything we could do besides following all the safety guidelines (which I had previously done the first time I got hacked) to help me from getting hacked again. THE ONLY RESPONSE the playstation associate could give me was ‚Äútheir is no suspicious activity on the account‚Äù being frustrated as to why I couldn‚Äôt get help I asked if I can speak with  someone else. I was then laughed at and told no. This is when my frustration peaked to the point of tears and I said thank you and goodbye. The following day an application was being updated on my ps4. When it was finished updating I was about to go on, but then my account got signed out of. So when I went to go log back in, I received a message saying my account has been locked for 14 days due to misconduct. AGAIN I am frustrated. AGAIN I went on to contact playstation for assistance. And AGAIN I am told there is nothing they can do to help. I am on playstation with friends almost everyday playing online. I have never been more upset with a company to how they are handling customer service. And this is coming from someone who has to deal with customers everyday. I have always been one to say how playstation is so much better than xbox. But now I have lost complete faith in playstation. Is there anyone out there that can give me an idea of what to do next?
